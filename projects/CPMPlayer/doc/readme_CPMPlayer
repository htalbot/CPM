Template exe
------------

DPO tends to use at least two source files for executables. The first one
being CPMPlayer.cpp and the second one being CPMPlayerAppLayer.cpp.

CPMPlayer.cpp contains bootstrap of application while CPMPlayerAppLayer.cpp contains
everything related to the application itself.

This is only one approach among many others...

After applying modifications according to the needs, this project
just have to be built and tested by launching it.
