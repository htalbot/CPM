Template tao_object_dll
-----------------------

This template contains:

    -   CPMObjDummy_i.h/.cpp

        These files contain the implementation of the interface specified when
        creating the project from the tao_object_dll template.

        They have to be changed according to the interface specified when
        creating the project from the tao_object_dll template

    -   test_CPMObjDummyAppLayer.cpp

        Application acting as a Corba server hosting the object. It is used
        to activate the Corba object  in a way that a Corba client can call
        services of the object.

        Here is the line to change
        (indicated by  '// <--' at the end of the lines):

            - ID of the object reference (obj_impl_ref_name)
              For example: change obj_impl_ref_name by CPMObjDummyObject1

    -   test_CPMObjDummy_clientAppLayer.cpp

        Application acting as a Corba client using the services of the object.

        Here are the lines to change
        (indicated by  '// <--' at the end of the lines):

            - ID of the object reference (OBJ_REF_NAME): the same ID as
              in test_CPMObjDummyAppLayer.cpp
              For example: change OBJ_REF_NAME by CPMObjDummyObject1

            - The object location

              For example: change

                char szRefLocation[] = "corbaloc:iiop:localhost:10000/"OBJ_REF_NAME;

                by

                char szRefLocation[] = "corbaloc:iiop:10.0.2.15:20000/"OBJ_REF_NAME;

              In fact, this is the location that is specified when we run
              test_CPMObjDummyAppLayer. 'localhost' is the address of the server
              and '10000' is the IP port used by Corba for this server.

            - The right interface

              Replace the calls generated with the template by the actual
              interface calls.

After having built the projects we can test by:

    - Starting the server

        (release) test_CPMObjDummy_server -ORBListenEndPoints iiop://localhost:10000
        (debug) test_CPMObjDummy_serverd -ORBListenEndPoints iiop://localhost:10000

            The server will wait for requests.

            Notice that iiop is the same as the one set in client
            application.

    - Starting the client

        (release) test_CPMObjDummy_client
        (debug) test_CPMObjDummy_clientd
