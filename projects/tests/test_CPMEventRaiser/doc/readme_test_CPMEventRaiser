Template exe
------------

DPO tends to use at least two source files for executables. The first one
being test_CPMEventRaiser.cpp and the second one being test_CPMEventRaiserAppLayer.cpp.

test_CPMEventRaiser.cpp contains bootstrap of application while test_CPMEventRaiserAppLayer.cpp contains
everything related to the application itself.

This is only one approach among many others...

After applying modifications according to the needs, this project
just have to be built and tested by launching it.
