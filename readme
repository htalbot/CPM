CPM means Corba Process Management.

Opposed to DCOM with which a server is launched when we get reference on an
object hosted by the server, Corba process must be launched explicitely before
using an object.

CPM defines Corba processes intervening in a system and launch them. It is
some kind of repository implementation.


CPM has been generated with DPO (https://github.com/htalbot/DPOpp)

- Generate projects/solution with dpo.pl

    Note: I put TAO_CodecFactory, TAO_CodecFactoryd, TAO_SvcUtils,
    TAO_SvcUtilsd, TAO_PI, TAO_PId, TAO_ValueType and TAO_ValueTyped in runtime
    dependencies because they can't be fetched from dependencies by DPO.

- Build

- To push it into a pool, freeze it with dpo.pl (https://github.com/htalbot/DPOpp)
